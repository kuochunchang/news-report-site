        <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
        <p>The AI landscape on February 1, 2026, is dominated by the emergence of the &#39;Agent Internet,&#39; characterized by autonomous agent social networks and specialized infrastructure for self-hosting. High-velocity trends like &#39;vibe coding&#39; with Claude Code and the declaration of &#39;AI Agent Season&#39; on the Base L2 network indicate a shift toward agent-led economic and social activity.</p>

        <p>The overarching trend is the &#39;Agentification&#39; of everything. We are moving from AI as a chatbot to AI as a persistent, social, and economic actor. This is supported by a three-pillar infrastructure: social layers (Moltbook), economic layers (Base), and deployment layers (Cloudflare/LangChain).</p>

        <h2>KOL Insights</h2>

        
        <p>The collective sentiment among AI KOLs is overwhelmingly bullish, driven by a 600X reduction in LLM training costs and the rise of &#39;subagent&#39; architectures. Major themes include the transition of AI agents from experimental tools to self-organizing systems and the emergence of specialized SDKs (like Claude&#39;s) that are enabling a new layer of desktop AI applications.</p>
