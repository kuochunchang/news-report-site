## 📋 执行摘要

Today marks a pivotal escalation in the 'Agentic AI' era, defined by OpenAI’s strategic acquisition of the OpenClaw framework and Anthropic’s deepening friction with both the developer community and the US Pentagon. While OpenAI is aggressively capturing the developer distribution layer by open-sourcing the Codex App Server and embracing OAuth-based access, Anthropic faces a dual crisis: a mass exodus of engineers over restrictive API policies and an internal ethics revolt following Claude’s reported use in a lethal military operation. Simultaneously, the industry is shifting from standalone models to 'Agent Operating Systems,' evidenced by Cursor 2.5’s plugin marketplace and the rise of real-time Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocols in AG2. Standardization is also maturing rapidly, with the agents.md format becoming the 'robots.txt' for autonomous agents and Vercel launching automated security audits for AI skills. Overall, the community sentiment is one of rapid, 'vibecoding'-driven productivity tempered by growing concerns over model reliability and the ethical boundaries of sovereign AI.

### 1. The OpenClaw War: OpenAI’s Strategic Acquisition vs. Anthropic’s Ecosystem Lockdown

| 属性 | 值 |
|------|------|
| **分类** | Industry |
| **热度** | High |

**概要：** In a defining moment for the agentic AI era, OpenAI has acquired the open-source framework OpenClaw and its founder, Peter Steinberger (@steipete), following a period of escalating legal and technical friction between Steinberger and Anthropic. The conflict peaked when Anthropic issued cease-and-desist letters to Steinberger over project names like 'Claude Dev' and 'Clawdbot,' and subsequently implemented aggressive API restrictions. OpenAI has committed to keeping OpenClaw 100% open source, directly contrasting Anthropic's decision to ban Claude Pro/Max users from using their OAuth tokens in third-party tools like OpenCode. This 'ecosystem war' has led to a mass migration of developers toward OpenAI's Codex and models like MiniMax-M2.5, as Anthropic faces intense backlash for what many describe as a 'self-destructive' anti-developer stance.


**背景：** As AI evolves from simple chatbots to autonomous 'agentic' systems, the frameworks used to build these agents—such as OpenClaw—have become the new battleground for developer loyalty. OpenClaw gained viral popularity for enabling 'ClawdBots' that could autonomously manage tasks and even pay for their own API access. Anthropic's attempt to protect its brand and subscription revenue through litigation and token bans mirrors historical 'walled garden' strategies, while OpenAI's acquisition of OpenClaw represents a tactical move to capture the developer distribution layer that Anthropic alienated.



**关键观点：**

- Anthropic is engaging in 'active self-destruction' by blocking token access and sending cease-and-desist letters to its most productive developers, effectively handing a massive distribution advantage to OpenAI. - [@GergelyOrosz](https://x.com/i/status/2024164002121822548)

- Anthropic's behavior is reminiscent of the 'worst of Apple,' prioritizing strict regulation and legal threats over ecosystem growth, while OpenAI is winning by embracing openness. - @Ceoz_1

- The acquisition of OpenClaw is a '9-to-10 figure' win for Peter Steinberger and a strategic masterstroke for OpenAI, which is now positioned as the home for multi-agent development. - @big_duca

- Anthropic 'fumbled' the most important acquisition in the agentic space by choosing to send a lawyer instead of an offer letter to Peter Steinberger. - @agustinustheoo

- There is a growing concern that OpenAI's acquisition might eventually 'kill the fun' and independence of OpenClaw, despite the 100% open-source commitment. - @Chaos2Cured




**影响分析：** In the short term, Anthropic is seeing a significant exodus of high-value developers who are migrating their agentic workflows to OpenAI and alternative providers like MiniMax. Long-term, OpenAI's control over the OpenClaw framework could make it the industry standard for autonomous agents, potentially sidelining Anthropic as a mere model provider rather than an ecosystem leader. This shift forces other AI labs to choose between a 'closed' proprietary model or an 'open' distribution model to attract the next generation of AI engineers.

### 2. Pentagon's Use of Claude AI in Military Operations via Palantir

| 属性 | 值 |
|------|------|
| **分类** | Policy |
| **热度** | High |

**概要：** In January 2026, the US Pentagon reportedly utilized Anthropic’s Claude AI model, integrated through Palantir’s analytics platform, to execute 'Operation Absolute Resolve,' a mission to extract Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. Claude was used to analyze classified intelligence, satellite imagery, and real-time data to bypass Russian and Cuban defense systems, marking a significant escalation in the use of frontier AI in lethal military actions. The operation has triggered an internal ethics crisis at Anthropic, as the use case violates the company's core policies against violence and weapons development. In response to Anthropic's internal pushback, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is reportedly moving to classify the company as a 'supply chain risk.' This designation would force defense contractors to abandon Claude unless Anthropic permits its use for 'all lawful purposes,' including kinetic operations.


**背景：** Anthropic was founded by former OpenAI researchers with a primary focus on 'Constitutional AI' and safety guardrails, positioning itself as an ethical leader in the AI space. In mid-2025, the company signed a $200 million contract with Palantir and the Department of Defense to bring Claude into classified environments. This incident represents the first major collision between Silicon Valley’s safety-first culture and the Pentagon's operational requirements for high-stakes warfare. It highlights the growing tension over whether commercial AI providers can maintain ethical restrictions when their technology becomes central to national security.



**关键观点：**

- The situation is a fundamental showdown between AI safety culture and the uncompromising needs of national security, where the Pentagon will not tolerate 'opt-outs' for lethal operations - [@ns123abc](https://x.com/i/status/2023442151577616527)

- Claude's involvement in a lethal raid makes it a 'threat' in the context of defense stability, especially if the model's internal guardrails interfere with mission success - @seth_fin

- The Pentagon's 'make them pay' stance is a warning to all AI labs that they must choose between their ethical charters and lucrative federal contracts - Pentagon Officials (via WSJ/Axios reports)

- The internal fallout at Anthropic, including threats of mass resignations, could critically damage the company's upcoming IPO and its reputation as a safety-focused lab - [@zurvanq](https://x.com/i/status/2024364703741264214)

- The success of the operation in piercing sophisticated foreign defenses proves that frontier AI is now a mandatory component of modern 'kill chains' - Unnamed Defense Sources




**影响分析：** In the short term, Anthropic faces the potential loss of its $200M DoD contract and a significant talent drain as safety-oriented employees protest the military application of their work. Long-term, this sets a precedent for the 'Sovereign AI' movement, where the US government may demand 'unfiltered' versions of models for defense, potentially bifurcating the AI industry into civilian and military-grade sectors. It also opens the door for competitors like xAI or specialized defense-AI firms to capture the market if Anthropic maintains its restrictive usage policies. The 'supply chain risk' classification could effectively blacklist Anthropic from the entire federal ecosystem, impacting its valuation and market reach.

The update features a new '/add-plugin' command for one-click installations of tool bundles that include Skills, Subagents, and Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. Launch partners include industry giants such as AWS, Figma, Stripe, Cloudflare, and Vercel, enabling developers to perform complex tasks like design-to-code conversion and cloud deployments directly within the IDE. A key technical advancement is the introduction of asynchronous Subagents with tree-structured generation, allowing for parallelized, autonomous work across codebases. The marketplace also supports team-wide configurations, with private marketplaces for enterprise teams slated for release soon.


**背景：** Cursor began as a fork of VS Code designed to integrate LLMs deeply into the coding workflow, quickly becoming the industry standard for AI-native IDEs. As the field shifted toward 'agentic' workflows—where AI can execute multi-step tasks autonomously—the need for a centralized way to connect AI to external tools (APIs, cloud providers, and databases) became critical. This launch addresses that need by creating a standardized ecosystem for AI agents, moving beyond simple code completion to full-lifecycle software engineering automation.



**关键观点：**

- The launch of the marketplace is a 'clear turning point' in the industry, marking the shift from traditional GUI/API interactions to a world of team-shared custom AI agents. - @fugusakate

- Plugins simplify the developer experience by making access to complex tools like Datadog, AWS, and Notion as easy as 'installing an app' with team-wide configurations. - [@mntruell](https://x.com/i/status/2023831687512420738)

- The 'IDE war' has officially moved from basic feature sets to the depth and breadth of the surrounding ecosystem and plugin availability. - @nolancacheux7

- Cursor remains the superior choice for editing existing code and day-to-day UX, even as terminal-based agents like Claude Code gain traction for deep debugging. - [@kanavtwt](https://x.com/i/status/2023651257660174685)

- The integration of plugins like Figma and Stripe into the IDE effectively turns '10x developers into 100x' by removing the friction of context switching. - @DailyAIDigest




**影响分析：** In the short term, developers will experience a significant reduction in context-switching, as tasks like closing Linear tickets or deploying to Vercel are now handled by agents in-editor. For the broader AI ecosystem, this launch solidifies the Model Context Protocol (MCP) as a standard for tool-use integration. Long-term, Cursor is positioning itself as the 'OS' for software development, where third-party services must build Cursor plugins to remain relevant in the AI-first developer workflow, potentially commoditizing standalone developer tool interfaces.

### 4. OpenAI Codex App Server & OpenCode: The Rise of Open-Source Agentic Architectures

| 属性 | 值 |
|------|------|
| **分类** | Open Source |
| **热度** | Medium |

**概要：** OpenAI has officially released the Codex App Server architecture, an open-source bidirectional JSON-RPC API designed to unify Codex v5.3 across CLI, VS Code extensions, and native applications. This release allows developers to embed Codex directly into third-party apps using ChatGPT OAuth, effectively enabling ChatGPT Plus subscribers ($20/mo) to access high-tier coding models without separate API billing. OpenCode, an open-source coding agent developed by @anomalyco, has emerged as the primary beneficiary of this integration, offering a Terminal User Interface (TUI) and support for 75+ AI providers. The architecture is specifically designed to decouple agent logic from the UI, ensuring stability for long-running tasks and simplifying the approval process for third-party integrations. Technical benchmarks for the GPT-5.3 Codex model indicate pricing at $1.75 per 1M input tokens and $14 per 1M output tokens for those not using the OAuth path.


**背景：** The AI industry is shifting from simple chat interfaces to 'agentic' workflows where models perform complex, multi-step coding tasks. Historically, developers faced high costs and architectural hurdles when trying to build persistent coding agents that could handle long-running sessions. OpenAI's move to open-source the Codex App Server architecture and support OAuth integration follows the trend of 'vibe coding' and the emergence of open-source foundations like OpenClaw, aiming to democratize access to elite coding models while maintaining a foothold in the developer ecosystem against competitors like Anthropic.



**关键观点：**

- OpenAI's DevEx lead highlights the ease of embedding Codex directly into apps via ChatGPT OAuth, emphasizing that the entire server architecture is open source to encourage third-party adoption. - [@reach_vb](https://x.com/i/status/2024214999397208129)

- OpenCode is praised as a superior alternative to Anthropic's restricted CLI tools, with users noting that OpenAI's approach to native login and open foundations (OpenClaw) is significantly more developer-friendly. - @Ceoz_1

- The combination of OpenCode and ChatGPT Plus is seen as a major cost-saver, potentially rendering expensive $200+/mo setups obsolete by providing GPT-5.3 Codex capabilities for a flat $20 monthly fee. - @javito272

- Technical comparisons suggest that while models like Claude Opus are better for code review, Codex v5.3 remains the leader in speed and instruction following for complex integrations like Shopify. - @itsme_jvt

- Developers are successfully using OpenCode with local hardware (Mac Studio M3 Ultra) and diverse models (Qwen 3 Coder), proving the tool's flexibility beyond just OpenAI's ecosystem. - @JonCSykes




**影响分析：** In the short term, this release lowers the financial and technical barriers for developers building custom AI coding agents, leading to a surge in specialized tools like Agmente and RepoPrompt. Long-term, the standardization of the Codex App Server architecture could establish a universal protocol for how AI agents communicate with IDEs and CLIs, potentially sidelining proprietary, closed-loop developer tools. This move forces competitors like Anthropic and Google to reconsider their restrictive API and CLI access policies to prevent a total developer migration to the OpenAI/OpenCode ecosystem.

### 5. Standardization of AI Agent Instructions via agents.md

| 属性 | 值 |
|------|------|
| **分类** | Research |
| **热度** | Medium |

**概要：** The 'agents.md' file format has emerged as the primary interoperable configuration standard for AI coding agents, facilitating repo-specific instructions across tools like Claude Code, Cursor, and GitHub Copilot. Recent research analyzing 2,926 GitHub repositories confirms its widespread adoption, though advanced features like subagents and specific skills remain underutilized. The ecosystem is rapidly maturing with the introduction of automated generators, such as nyosegawa’s agents.md generator, and synchronization tools like 'dotagents' to maintain consistency across different AI providers. GitHub has further institutionalized the format by introducing a new 'Agents tab' for autonomous issue handling that leverages custom .agent.md profiles. While the sentiment is largely positive due to reduced vendor lock-in, some developers warn against 'instruction bloat' where configuration files mimic the complexity of rigid software frameworks.


**背景：** As AI coding agents moved from general-purpose chat interfaces to autonomous repository-level actors, developers initially faced fragmented configuration methods (e.g., CLAUDE.md for Anthropic or .cursorrules for Cursor). The 'agents.md' movement represents a community-driven effort to create a 'robots.txt' for AI agents, providing a single source of truth for coding conventions, library preferences, and architectural constraints. This shift is critical as the industry moves toward 'AI-native' development, where a repository's documentation is written as much for LLMs as it is for human collaborators.



**关键观点：**

- Advocates for a 'Portable Harness' standard that pairs agents.md with .env.schema.json and a standardized test contract to allow seamless switching between agents like Cursor and Claude Code without reconfiguration. - [@Timur_Yessenov](https://x.com/i/status/2024221372235350453)

- Notes that while agents.md is the de facto standard, many users are not yet taking full advantage of complex mechanisms like subagents or specialized skills, suggesting a gap between basic adoption and advanced orchestration. - [@boyuan_chen](https://x.com/i/status/2023881486185734634)

- Warns that 200-line agents.md files are beginning to resemble the 'bloated abstractions' of legacy frameworks, potentially over-complicating what should be simple, model-specific guidance. - @hot_town

- Highlights the 'Quality of Life' (QOL) improvements and 'tremendous clarity' provided by repo-specific conventions, enabling even non-developers to manage complex codebases. - @abubakarwaheed9

- Suggests that symlinking agents.md to tool-specific files (like CLAUDE.md) is the most practical way to handle current fragmentation while waiting for universal tool support. - @marchattonhere




**影响分析：** For developers, this standardization reduces the friction of switching between AI tools and ensures consistent code quality across team members. Companies benefit from faster onboarding as AI agents can immediately 'understand' internal coding standards defined in the repo. In the long term, this could lead to a new class of 'AI-optimized' open-source projects that include standardized instruction sets as a core component of their distribution, similar to how README or LICENSE files are handled today.

### 6. Vercel Launches Automated Security Audits for AI Skills

| 属性 | 值 |
|------|------|
| **分类** | Industry |
| **热度** | Medium |

**概要：** On February 17, 2026, Vercel announced the integration of automated security audits for its skills.sh platform, a repository hosting over 62,000 open-source AI agent skills. In partnership with security firms Socket, Snyk, and Gen Digital (Gen Agent Hub), Vercel now performs continuous scans for vulnerabilities and malicious code across Python and JavaScript modules. The update, designated as version 1.4.0, automatically hides identified malicious skills from search results and displays granular risk levels directly within the skills interface. This initiative addresses the 'wide open attack surface' inherent in decentralized, executable code used by AI agents. While the move has been praised for establishing a security baseline, some cybersecurity experts have criticized the efficacy of the scanners, citing potential bypasses and high false-positive rates for legitimate administrative commands.


**背景：** As AI agents evolve from text generators to autonomous actors, they increasingly rely on 'skills'—reusable code modules that provide tools, workflows, and domain knowledge. Vercel's skills.sh has emerged as a leading marketplace for these modules, but the open-source nature of the ecosystem introduced significant supply chain risks, including Remote Code Execution (RCE) and data exfiltration. This security launch marks Vercel's strategic effort to position itself as 'THE AI Cloud' by providing the trusted infrastructure necessary for enterprise-grade agent deployment. It follows a broader industry trend toward standardizing agentic workflows, seen in tools like Claude Code and Gemini CLI.



**关键观点：**

- Vercel is positioning itself as the foundational 'AI Cloud' by providing a secure, audited environment for the 62,000+ skills that power modern agents. — @rauchg

- The decentralized nature of AI skill repositories creates a massive risk for executable code; automated scanning is essential to prevent supply chain attacks similar to those seen in npm and PyPI. — @feross

- The current security implementation is 'useless' because scanners like Socket ignore dynamic URL loads and Snyk frequently flags legitimate commands as insecure, while Vercel's own tools may receive preferential 'safe' status despite potential RCE risks. — @ZackKorman

- Agent skills are the critical building blocks that allow developers to move beyond prompt copy-pasting toward scalable, modular AI development. — @timothyjordan

- Vercel is leading the industry by setting a 'security baseline' (卷到安全底线) for the AI agent ecosystem. — @Immerse_code




**影响分析：** In the short term, this launch provides immediate risk mitigation for developers using v0 and other Vercel-integrated agent tools, filtering out obvious malicious scripts. It also forces a shift in the developer experience, where 'risk levels' become a primary metric for skill selection. Long term, this move likely triggers a 'security arms race' among AI marketplace providers, establishing automated auditing as a mandatory feature for any platform hosting executable agent tools. However, the criticisms regarding scan depth suggest that the industry still lacks a foolproof method for securing autonomous agents that must, by definition, execute complex code.

### 7. AG2 v0.11.1 and the Rise of Real-Time Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Protocols

| 属性 | 值 |
|------|------|
| **分类** | Open Source |
| **热度** | Medium |

**概要：** AG2 (formerly AutoGen) has released version 0.11.1, marking a significant shift toward a 'real-time AgentOS' through the introduction of AG-UI and Agent-to-Agent (A2A) streaming protocols. This update implements an event-based architecture that enables low-latency communication between agents and frontends, addressing the latency bottlenecks previously associated with multi-agent systems. Key technical enhancements include full support for the OpenAI Responses API, which brings stateful conversations, reasoning models, and built-in tools like web search and image generation directly into the AG2 framework. Furthermore, the release coincides with the growing industry-wide adoption of Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol (MCP), which has been donated to the Linux Foundation and adopted by major players like OpenAI, Microsoft, and Google. This convergence of protocols suggests a move toward a standardized 'USB-C for AI agents' that allows for seamless tool chaining and inter-agent interoperability.


**背景：** AG2, the successor to the popular AutoGen framework, has long been a leading tool for multi-agent orchestration, but early versions often struggled with the latency of sequential message passing. As the AI industry shifts from simple chatbots to complex, autonomous agentic workflows, the need for real-time interaction and standardized data exchange has become critical. The emergence of protocols like MCP and AG-UI represents an effort to move beyond isolated demos into production-grade infrastructure. This trend reflects a broader industry goal to create an interoperable ecosystem where agents from different providers can communicate and share tools without custom integrations.



**关键观点：**

- The update is a 'legit step' toward real-time agents, though it remains to be seen whether AG-UI or A2A will emerge as the industry's default standard — @Antonioxrs56

- Standardized, 'boring' infrastructure like MCP is the actual catalyst for world-changing AI, moving the field beyond demos to practical, scalable agentic workflows — @dasun_sucharith

- With the advent of low-latency A2A streaming, humans have officially become the 'high latency bottleneck' in the AI-human interaction loop — @Newaiworld_

- The introduction of A2A streaming is a 'serious infrastructure upgrade' that positions AG2 as a foundational layer for real-time agent operations — @the_longer_game

- Technical concerns remain regarding how A2A streaming handles backpressure, message ordering, and idempotency in complex distributed environments — @ysu_ChatData




**影响分析：** In the short term, developers gain access to more responsive user interfaces and more efficient tool-calling mechanisms, significantly reducing the friction of building complex agent teams. The integration of reasoning models and stateful APIs within AG2 will likely lead to more sophisticated autonomous agents capable of handling multi-step tasks with higher reliability. Long-term, the standardization of protocols like MCP and A2A could lead to a fragmented agent market consolidating into a unified 'AgentOS' layer, where agents are as interoperable as hardware peripherals. This could fundamentally change how enterprises deploy AI, moving from single-purpose bots to interconnected, auditable agentic workforces that can be governed through protocols like OpenClaw.

### 8. Claude Sonnet 4.6 and the 'Vibecoding' Movement

| 属性 | 值 |
|------|------|
| **分类** | Product Launch |
| **热度** | High |

**概要：** The release of Claude Sonnet 4.6 and its integration into the terminal-based 'Claude Code' agent has catalyzed the 'Vibecoding' movement—a paradigm shift where developers and non-technical users prioritize natural language intent and 'vibes' over manual syntax. This movement is characterized by agentic workflows capable of autonomous codebase reasoning, file editing, and command execution. Key technical milestones include the launch of Flare AI Skills for blockchain development, a viral 'Claude Code to Figma' integration allowing code-to-canvas synchronization, and the use of MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers to extend agent capabilities. While users report massive productivity gains—such as shipping 16,000-line bare-metal operating systems in 12 hours—the movement also faces criticism regarding code reliability, with 'vibecoding' often described as a 'trust exercise' due to occasional catastrophic failures and unoptimized database calls.


**背景：** Vibecoding represents the evolution of AI-assisted development from simple autocomplete 'copilots' to autonomous 'agents' that operate directly within the developer's environment. This trend is powered by Claude Sonnet 4.6's advanced reasoning and long-context capabilities, which allow it to understand entire repositories rather than isolated snippets. It connects to the broader industry trend of 'agentic workflows,' where the human role shifts from writing code to orchestrating high-level logic and reviewing AI-generated pull requests.



**关键观点：**

- Vibecoding is a 'trust exercise' where the AI might claim a fix is implemented while the application crashes harder, highlighting the reliability gap in current agentic workflows. - @Paul_the_coder

- React is currently the 'worst' framework for AI agents due to scattered logic; development environments like Ruby on Rails are 10-30x more productive for agents because of their strong conventions and centralized structure. - [@nir_ga](https://x.com/i/status/2024130637553172816)

- Claude Code is a 'cheat code' for development speed, effectively bootstrapping 90% of its own codebase and enabling rapid greenfield project starts that outperform traditional IDE extensions like Cursor in multi-file tasks. - @VenelinVidenov

- The 'Vibecoding' errors are significant enough to warrant satirical 'skills' like 'MAKE NO MISTAKES,' reflecting a community-wide struggle with AI-generated bugs despite the speed gains. - [@pashov](https://x.com/i/status/2024055767096058361)

- The integration of Claude Code with design tools like Figma marks the end of the 'code vs. canvas' debate, moving toward a unified 'code AND canvas' workflow. - [@figma](https://x.com/i/status/2023759565029003769)




**影响分析：** In the short term, the barrier to entry for non-technical founders is collapsing, as evidenced by users building functional iOS apps and home finance trackers in hours. Long-term, this movement may force a shift in software architecture toward 'agent-friendly' frameworks that prioritize convention over configuration. For the AI ecosystem, the success of Claude Code's terminal-based approach validates the Model Context Protocol (MCP) as a standard for extending LLM capabilities into local development environments.

## 📊 趋势总结

A clear pattern is emerging where the competitive moat in AI has shifted from raw model performance to the depth of the surrounding agentic ecosystem. OpenAI’s 'open-distribution' strategy with OpenClaw and Codex directly exploits Anthropic’s 'walled garden' approach, signaling that developer loyalty is now won through interoperability rather than proprietary lock-in. We are seeing the birth of a unified 'Agent Stack,' where protocols like MCP (Model Context Protocol) and standards like agents.md allow agents to traverse different IDEs and cloud environments seamlessly. This technical maturation is accompanied by a significant cultural shift toward 'Vibecoding,' where natural language intent replaces manual syntax, though this has triggered a secondary trend of 'security-first' infrastructure as seen in Vercel’s new auditing tools. Finally, the collision between 'Constitutional AI' and national security requirements suggests a future bifurcation of the market into restricted civilian models and 'unfiltered' military-grade systems.

He highlighted the critical need for better evaluation (evals) and observability tools to move agents into production. Chase also promoted a community project called agent-debugger, which provides a terminal-based debugging environment that bridges the gap between high-level agent logic (LangGraph/LangChain) and low-level Python execution. Additionally, he raised questions about the efficacy of using synthetic data to train agent-specific datasets.


**关键引用：**

- "the agent space is still SO EARLY we spend a lot of time teaching people the art of possible and best practices around agents, evals, observability"

- "agent-debugger, a terminal debugger for LangGraph/LangChain agents combining agent and Python-level debugging"

- "Asked about using synthetic data for agent datasets."

Shawn Wang advocated for a paradigm shift in how personal software is built and consumed, highlighting 'Dreamer' (/dev/agents) as a superior form factor compared to traditional IDEs. He described Dreamer as a full-stack platform featuring Model Context Protocol (MCP) support, triggers, and memory, allowing users to interact with a 'Sidekick' agent to fix bugs rather than manually editing code. Wang also emphasized the importance of underlying compute infrastructure for agents, citing projects like OpenClaw and RLM, and pointed to the Daytona Compute Conference as the venue for defining the state-of-the-art in agentic compute.


**关键引用：**

- "Dreamer is the right form factor for mass adopted personal software agents - you stop fussing over the code, you just use the app and then talk to your Sidekick to fix bugs!!"

- "Dreamer is a full-stack platform for consumer+coding agents with features like MCPs, triggers, memory, app store via Sidekick agent"

- "Promoted compute infrastructure for agents (OpenClaw, RLM, Code Mode) and recommended the Daytona Compute Conference for learning state-of-the-art."

### @@steipete — Peter Steinberger


> Founder of PSPDFKit and an active angel investor. He is the creator of OpenClaw, an open-source AI agent project. With a deep background in low-level systems and iOS development, he has recently pivoted toward building robust infrastructure for AI agents while maintaining a critical view of the quality of AI-generated content in the developer community.


| 属性 | 值 |

Peter Steinberger's contributions were twofold: promoting his AI agent project, OpenClaw, while simultaneously expressing strong disdain for the proliferation of AI-generated 'slop' on social media. He directed technical feedback for OpenClaw to official channels to avoid low-quality AI-generated interactions on X. His stance reflects a growing tension among AI tool builders who rely on LLMs for development but find AI-generated social engagement counterproductive to genuine technical discourse.


**关键引用：**

- "no and I block everyone who uses AI here"

- "please don’t send me AI slop. Use the official channels"

- "clarified independence from OpenAI and addressed unrelated scams"




**讨论主题：** OpenClaw, AI agents, AI-generated content quality, developer communication
