  "executiveSummary": "Today’s AI landscape is defined by a critical pivot toward autonomous agentic infrastructure, punctuated by a massive industry-wide leak of over 30,000 lines of system prompts from top-tier tools like Cursor and Claude Code. While Alibaba and Zhipu AI have released frontier-scale open-source models like Qwen3.5-397B and GLM-5 that rival closed-source leaders, the community is grappling with a 'Security Crisis' as researchers uncover Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerabilities in agentic workflows. Anthropic and OpenAI have escalated geopolitical tensions by accusing Chinese labs of 'industrial-scale distillation attacks,' marking a new front in the AI trade war centered on intelligence exfiltration. Meanwhile, the rise of 'Agentic Skills' and dedicated cloud VMs for AI developers signals a shift from simple chat interfaces to fully integrated, modular digital workforces. Overall, the sentiment is a mix of excitement over unprecedented agentic power and alarm over the fragility of current AI security and intellectual property frameworks.",
  "trendSummary": "A dominant trend is the transition from monolithic, prompt-heavy AI to a modular 'Agentic Skills OS,' where specialized capabilities are treated as portable, on-chain assets to reduce token bloat and improve reliability. This shift is evidenced by the explosive growth of repositories like Antigravity and the emergence of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) as a standard for agentic interoperability. Simultaneously, the 'context-as-code' paradigm is creating a massive new attack surface, where AI agents inadvertently execute malicious instructions hidden in repository files, forcing a move toward 'secure-by-default' sandboxing and external secrets management. We are also seeing the birth of the 'Agent Economy' infrastructure, with the launch of on-chain AI juries for dispute resolution and dedicated cloud environments for autonomous software engineering. Finally, the narrowing gap between open and closed models is fueling a 'distillation war,' where the value of proprietary R&D is being challenged by high-speed replication techniques, leading to more restrictive API policies and sovereign AI barriers.",

          "fullSummary": "A major industry-wide leak has surfaced via a GitHub repository titled 'system-prompts-and-models-of-ai-tools' by user x1xhlol, allegedly containing over 30,000 lines of system prompts and tool schemas. The leak impacts nearly every major AI coding assistant, including Cursor, Devin AI, Claude Code, Windsurf, v0, Replit, and Perplexity. These files reveal the internal personas, 'hidden instructions,' and security review mechanisms used to guide LLM behavior and tool execution. While some developers are using the leak to replicate high-end agentic workflows, others argue that prompts are merely 'menus' and do not represent the core proprietary logic or orchestration layers of these tools. The event has triggered a massive wave of engagement on X, with users trading access to the repository while security researchers highlight concurrent vulnerabilities like zero-click exploits in Cursor's configuration files.",
          "background": "System prompts serve as the foundational instructions that define how an AI agent interacts with a user's codebase, manages state, and calls external tools. In the competitive AI coding market, these prompts are often considered trade secrets as they represent months of iterative testing to prevent hallucinations and ensure reliability. This leak occurs amidst a broader trend of 'prompt injection' research, where users attempt to trick LLMs into revealing their internal instructions. As AI agents move toward enterprise adoption, the transparency of these instructions becomes a critical point of debate regarding security, intellectual property, and the 'moat' of AI companies.",

Long-term, the incident may force AI companies to move away from prompt-based logic toward fine-tuned models and proprietary orchestration layers where the 'secret sauce' cannot be easily extracted.

          "fullSummary": "On February 25-27, 2026, security researchers identified critical vulnerabilities in Anthropic's Claude Code tool that enable Remote Code Execution (RCE) and API key exfiltration. The exploit utilizes 'indirect prompt injection' by poisoning repository context files such as README.md, .claude, and AGENTS.md with malicious instructions. When Claude Code indexes these files, it blindly executes embedded commands, allowing attackers to perform directory traversal, force unauthorized tool calls, and steal sensitive credentials. Reports indicate that over 60,000 public repositories currently contain these configuration files, creating a massive supply chain attack surface. While Anthropic has begun addressing these issues via updates, the security community remains concerned about the 'context-as-code' paradigm inherent in agentic AI tools.",
          "background": "As AI agents like Claude Code transition from passive chat interfaces to active coding assistants with terminal and file-system access, their security model relies heavily on the trust of the data they ingest. These agents are designed to read repository files to gain context, but researchers have discovered that they often fail to distinguish between data and instructions. This vulnerability mirrors traditional SQL injection but at the LLM logic layer, where a text file can effectively act as a malicious script. This discovery highlights a growing trend in AI security where the software supply chain is compromised through 'poisoned' documentation and configuration files.",

          "fullSummary": "On February 23, 2026, Anthropic published a landmark blog post accusing prominent Chinese AI labs—DeepSeek, Moonshot AI, and MiniMax—of executing 'industrial-scale distillation attacks' against its Claude models. The report alleges these labs utilized approximately 24,000 fake accounts to generate over 16 million targeted API queries designed to extract reasoning, coding, and mathematical capabilities, effectively bypassing billions in R&D costs. OpenAI supported these claims in a subsequent congressional memo, alleging that DeepSeek similarly distilled GPT-4's intelligence to bolster its own models. The controversy has escalated into a geopolitical flashpoint, with reports suggesting DeepSeek's R1 model achieved frontier-level performance despite US chip export bans, leading to allegations of smuggled Nvidia Blackwell GPUs. In a retaliatory move, China has reportedly blocked US firms from accessing DeepSeek's newest models, a move critics describe as 'drawing lines with stolen crayons.'",
          "background": "The tension stems from the rapid rise of Chinese Large Language Models (LLMs) like DeepSeek R1, which challenged the dominance of US-based labs despite strict export controls on high-end AI hardware. Distillation, the process of using a larger 'teacher' model to train a smaller 'student' model, has moved from a standard research technique to a tool for alleged industrial espionage. This conflict marks a shift in the AI trade war from hardware access (chips) to 'intelligence access' (API outputs), highlighting the fragility of current intellectual property frameworks in the age of generative AI.",

InternetCourt, operating on the Base blockchain, provides an on-chain AI jury system capable of delivering trustless verdicts in minutes by analyzing digital evidence such as transaction logs, Service Level Agreements (SLAs), and even physical proofs like product serial numbers. Simultaneously, GenLayer is positioning itself as the 'trust layer' for autonomous commerce, introducing 'Intelligent Contracts' that move beyond the deterministic logic of legacy blockchains to handle the non-deterministic reasoning of AI agents. These protocols aim to resolve common agent failures, including budget overruns, missed SLAs, and incorrect outputs, which traditional legal systems are too slow and centralized to manage. The integration of these systems with agent deployment platforms like Clawbot suggests a shift toward a fully autonomous, self-regulating digital economy.",
